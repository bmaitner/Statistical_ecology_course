# Overview

This repo contains materials related to a statistical ecology course I'm teaching. The course is based on Ben Bolker's Ecological Models and Data in R textbook (ISBN: 978-0691125220), and so the organization and topics covered are largely taken from that source. Any content here (aside from images and datasets that may be licensed otherwise) should be considered CC-BY, while code is licensed under an MIT license.
